# ðŸ§  Image Similarity Estimation using Siamese Network with Triplet Loss

## Overview

This project implements a Siamese neural network trained using **triplet loss** for **image similarity estimation**. The model learns to embed images into a feature space where similar images are close together and dissimilar images are far apart. The model is built in TensorFlow/Keras and leverages distributed training across GPUs for faster convergence.
The project includes data handling, model creation, training with freezing and fine-tuning, and detailed evaluation metrics.

## Key Features:
- âœ… TensorFlow `tf.data` pipeline for efficient data loading.
- âœ… Distributed training using `tf.distribute.Strategy`.
- âœ… Modular and scalable training script.
- âœ… Data pipeline using triplet generators.
- âœ… Triplet loss function (anchor, positive, negative).
- âœ… Model fine-tuning with checkpointing.
- âœ… Evaluation with confusion matrix and per-class metrics.
- âœ… Visualization of training loss and evaluation results.
- âœ… Easily adaptable for your own image datasets.

## Data Structure

Your dataset directory should be organized as follows:

```
root_dataset_dir/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ ID_1/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ image1.jpg
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ image2.jpg
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ ID_2/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ image1.jpg
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ image2.jpg
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚
â””â”€â”€ ID_N/
    â”œâ”€â”€ image1.jpg
    â”œâ”€â”€ image2.jpg
    â””â”€â”€ ...
```

- Each subfolder corresponds to one unique identity/class (`ID_1`, `ID_2`, â€¦).
- Each subfolder contains multiple images of that identity.
- The code selects triplets (anchor, positive, negative) based on these folders.

## Installation
Make sure you have Python 3.7+ and the following packages installed:

```
pip install tensorflow seaborn matplotlib pandas scikit-learn
```
